# Posture-Detection
Posture Detection with Mediapipe and OpenCV
Overview
This project aims to develop a real-time posture detection system using computer vision techniques. It utilizes a front-facing camera and the MediaPipe framework to detect and analyze the user's posture, particularly focusing on the sitting posture. The system provides visual feedback to encourage better ergonomic practices, especially for individuals who spend prolonged periods at a desk.

Features:

**Real-Time Posture Detection:** Utilizes a camera to capture video feed and analyze posture in real-time.

**Pose Estimation:** Leverages MediaPipe's pose estimation capabilities to identify key body landmarks.

**Posture Analysis:** Analyzes the alignment of the spine, position of the shoulders, and the angle of the neck to assess posture.

**Feedback System:** Provides on-screen feedback about the userâ€™s posture, suggesting adjustments when necessary.

**Angle Display:** Displays calculated angles for shoulders and neck for a better understanding of the posture analysis.

Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV-Python
MediaPipe
NumPy

Installation
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
Usage
To start the posture detection, simply run the posture_detection.py script:
python posture_detection.py
Ensure your environment has good lighting and the camera is positioned to capture your upper body from the front.
